        <ul type="disc">
            <li>
                <p>A licensed broker will list your home in the Middle Tennessee Multiple Listing Service (MLS)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This is the same MLS that is available to all Realtors seeking homes for buyers</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Additionally, your home listing will appear across the internet on sites such as Yahoo.com, AOL, Realtor.Com,
                    RealTracs.Com, and more</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You pay a Flat Fee for listing your home with us.&nbsp; You save thousands of dollars in listing commissions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You offer a “Buyers Agent Commission” (you choose the amount, usually between 2 and 3%), that will only be
                    payable if an agent brings you a buyer who purchases your home</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You retain the right to sell your home yourself and avoid the Buyers Agent Commission, entirely, if you find
                    the buyer yourself</p>
            </li>
