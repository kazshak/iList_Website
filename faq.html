        <h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The MLS & How It Works</li>
            <p>
                The MLS (Multiple Listing Service) local database is the most powerful tool used by real estate agents to find a home for
                the buyers they represent. Agents search MLS for homes that meet their buyer's criteria. They can search
                by numerous categories, including area, price, square footage, number of bedrooms, number of baths, and much
                more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Agents book appointments to show their clients from the information provided on the MLS listing. The showing instructions
                are provided by the listing agent.

            <li>Why Use A Lockbox?</li>
            <p>
                Lockboxes are not required, but they are ideal for having secure and convenient home showings. Buyers prefer sellers not
                be home during the showing. This allows buyers the time necessary to look at the home in detail and have
                open conversations while looking. This sometimes eliminates a second showing before making and offer. Sellers
                prefer a lockbox because it allows agents to show the home when the seller is at work or away. Lockboxes
                also enable last-minute and short notice showings, which often are the best, most motivated buyers (such
                as relocation buyers in town for a short time who need to buy a home quickly).
            </p>
            <li>What Is A CMA?</li>
            <p>
                CMA stands for Comparative Market Analysis. Your Realtor can help you determine the approximate value of your home, or the
                home you are considering purchasing, by examining similar homes nearby. Specifically, your Realtor will provide
                the selling prices for similar size homes that have sold in the area in the recent months. Additionally,
                your Realtor can provide you with the active listings in the area, and the current asking price. Armed with
                this information, you can more intelligently price your home to sell, or make an appropriate offer on a home
                you want to buy.
            </p>
            <li>Discount Broker vs. Full Priced Broker?</li>
            <p>
                The listing process is the same regardless of whether you list your home with us or a full priced real estate agent. With
                the cooperating commission you offer, your listing looks the same as other homes for sale by full priced
                agents. Agents are just as motivated to sell your home as any other home for sale. Nearly every local real
                estate company participates in the MLS. The MLS listing puts thousands of agents to work selling your home!
